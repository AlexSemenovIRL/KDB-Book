This three-day training course is ideal for those with limited or zero experience with kdb+. By the end of this kdb+ training course you will be fully able to use kdb+ to manage data from multiple data sources and interact with both in-memory and on-disk kdb+ installations. Reference website: http://code.kx.com k database plus High performance database, managing real time and historical data within a single platform Features: Column orientated Embedded query language - q In-memory and on-disk data access Optimized and configurable partitioning of on-disk data 64-bit architecture with built-in multi-threaded support Direct analysis on data High speed time series analysis Discrete and continuous joins 1.2 kdb+ Windows Intallation http://kx.com/software-download.php Download the free trial version of kdb+ for Windows Unzip the file and put the q folder in C drive The default home directory of q (QHOME) is c:nq, and the q executable is in c:nqnw32. This can be added to the path. If you wish to store q in a different directory and run it, you need to add the QHOME environment variable. To run q without referencing the full path, it should be added to the path variable Go to Start, right click on Computer, click Properties Click Advanced System Settings then Environment Variables To edit the path: In System Variables, select path and click edit Add c:nqnw32 at the start of the path definition To edit QHOME (if not stored in c:nq): Add QHOME as either as either a System Variable (for all users) or User Variable (for the current user only) Set it to c:nq (or wherever q is installed) Open a command prompt and type q to start a q session 1.3 kdb+ Unix Installation On unix platforms (OSX, Linux, Solaris) the default location of q is ∼/q (where ∼ is the current users home directory) Similarly to windows, if you want to run q from a different location you should create a QHOME environment variable. If you wish to make q accessible just by typing q, it needs to be on the path To create the environment variable, do export QHOME=∼/q To set the path, do export PATH=∼/q/m32:$PATH. m32 should be replaced with the specific directory for the required OS These commands will only have effect for the current session. To set them permanently,or for all uses, they should be set in a profile script which is sourced at session start up To run q, type q It is a good idea to install and use rlwrap when running kdb+ on unix "]
